These examples use human activity accelerometer data available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones
The aim is to classify the data segments into one of six catagories: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying
The data has 9 channels of accelerometer and gyroscope data:  total acceleration (x,y,z), body acceleration (x,y,z), and body gyroscope (x,y,z).
